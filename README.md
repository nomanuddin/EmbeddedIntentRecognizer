- Step 2: Respective class is instantiated, and the relative method is called
- Step 3: Required intent and info is displayed
- Step 4: exit keyword entered as question breaks the loop and application is closed

#### Future work:
- Regex/ Question parser implementation

- Using timeout in the main method loop logic
